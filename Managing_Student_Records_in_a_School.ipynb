How is each product's information captured using tuples, and what advantages do tuples provide in this scenario? How can we extract and manage unique product categories using sets, and why is it beneficial to do so? Additionally, how can we structure a dictionary to represent product details effectively and how does this improve information retrieval compared to tuples? When integrating these data structures, what challenges might arise, and how can we use the insights gained from analyzing product prices and categories to improve inventory management? Finally, how can the product list be dynamically updated as new items are added or existing items are removed, ensuring that it accurately reflects the current market offerings?"
